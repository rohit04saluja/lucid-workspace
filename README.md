An extension to seemlessly manage large workspaces

## ðŸ–‹ Inspiration

Getting lost while working with a large workspace is a real problem. It can get hard to find files and folders in the workspaces. Multiple open folder tress can eat up your explorer view space.
Lucid workspace aims to help you declutter. It provides you with an intuitive way to only see what is important.
