# 🗂 Lucid-workspace

> An extension to seemlessly manage large workspaces

## 🖋 Inspiration

Getting lost while working with a large workspace is a real problem. It can get hard to find files and folders in the workspaces. Multiple open folder tress can eat up your explorer view space.
Lucid workspace aims to help you declutter. It provides you with an intuitive way to only see what is important.

## 🚀 Get started

_lucid-workspace_ activates when there is an open workspace folder.

When active, _lucid-workspace_ can be found at ```Explorer```.

### Step 1 - _the welcome page_

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="_static/tree_view.png" /></td>
        <td>
            <p>This is the welcome screen.</p>
            <p>Add <code>Workspace Folder</code> to see the tree view.</p>
            <p>This hides the folder tree from Explorer, but can be viewed here</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
